Dear Reader,

This is an example cover letter to put in the content collection. Every `.mdx` file in this folder will be ignored by git except for this example.

Fill out the YAML up top to fill in the date and address of the company you're writing the letter to. Then you can use this space here to write your cover letter. Then you can print to save as a PDF.

Good luck with your applications.

Cheers,
\
